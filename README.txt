SMB2U Button Timer
==================

This is a really simple hack, that replaces the lives counter on the pause menu with an indicator for how many frames off the area transition your latest B press was.

Mostly this would be helpful for timing the frame perfect pickup of items after the subspace screens. Attempt to perform the trick then pause, and see how far off you were.

Good luck!
